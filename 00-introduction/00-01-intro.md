*Purpose of webpack:* automatize bundling

*Bundling:* assemble HTML, CSS, JS, images and all types of assets into a format that is usable for the browser

Example of other bundling tools:
- Grunt
- Gulp
-> issue: workflow written by hand

Webpack used underneath many tools (ex: create-react-app)

In webpack, project is a dependency graph. Configuration allows to customize the way it is treated and bundled.

In some sense, learning webpack config is like learning some declarative language.

(2 modes of bundling: development and production)

(Found JSTer, seems cool)

(also conferences are cool, such as React Finland (although I'm not from Finland (they must be nice)))
